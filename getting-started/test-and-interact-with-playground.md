# Test and interact with Playground

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/W7C1U8bRHaQ" %}

Once you have [compiled and deployed your contract ](compile-and-deploy-a-contract.md)and the deployment has appeared in the contract history, you can click on `Playground` to start interacting with it.\
The Playground is a custom view built around your contract functions and structure.\
On the left side you will see all your contract functions and arguments. You can test and interact with each function by clicking on `Try it.`\
On the right side of the Playground, Loki.code automatically generates the Ethers JS code to interact with each function. \
You can use this directly in your front-end application.
