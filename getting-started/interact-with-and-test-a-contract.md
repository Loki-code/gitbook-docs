# Interact with & test a contract

Once you've deployed your contract through Loki.code, you can then access its Playground. The Playground is a UI that allows you to interact with your contract by making calls and transactions off your contract and seeing its state update in real time.

### Prerequisites

1. [Github linked to Loki.code](link-a-github-repository.md)
2. [An existing project](create-a-new-project.md)
3. [A contract deployed through Loki.code](deploy-a-contract.md)

### Steps

From the Dashboard's left side bar, click on Projects, and then select the project that contains the contract you want to interact with.

In that project's page, click on Deploy in the left side bar. From here you will see several different tabs to choose from. Click on the Deployments tab which will display your the history of all the contracts you have deployed through Loki.code.

Locate the deployed contract that you want to interact with, and click on its respective Playground button in the bottom-right corner. You will be lead to your project's Playground, which should look similar to the image below.
