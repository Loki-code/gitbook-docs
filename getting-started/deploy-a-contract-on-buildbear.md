# Deploy a contract on Buildbear

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/MWev6IFBAhg" %}

To deploy a contract using a Buildbear fork, select Buildbear from the network dropdown. \
In the Buildbear config menu, select the network you want to fork and then select `Create Buildbear Testnet`. \
After a few seconds, your new network should appear. \
This will remain active as long as you use it but it will be discarded after 24 hours of inactivity. Before deploying your contract to the Buildbear fork, make sure you have added the new network to you wallet and request some testnet tokens from the faucet. \
Once you are all set, click on Deploy and your contract is now deployed using Buildbear. \
You can interact with this network the same way you would interact with any other testnet or mainnet.
