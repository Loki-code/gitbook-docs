### Compile contract

Once you are in your new project, you should see your repository structure. \
If you don't see it, click on the `Files` tab in your sidebar. \
To compile you contract, first select the Solidity file and then press the `Deploy` button in the top right corner. Confirm the selected contract and once again press `Compile`. Once compiling is successful, you'll be redirected to the `Deploy view`.

### Deploy contract

From the deploy view we can setup some settings like the target network you want to deploy on and the compiled version of the contract. \
After you have filled all the necessary details, click on `Deploy` and sign the transaction. \
Once the transaction has been executed your newly deployed contract should appear as an event in your contract history.
