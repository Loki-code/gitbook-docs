# Make an Organization

Loki.code is great for managing your deployments and interacting with your contracts as a web3 devops platform. However, the true value of Loki is taking that above and allowing your team to have shared access to your projects to coordinate on dApp management and to save as much time as possible on shipping your dApp from staging to mainnet.

With shared access to a project, Organizations allow team members with different roles to seamlessly contribute to and execute a successful deployment onto mainnet. Developers can push deploy requests up to Loki through a simple API call, contract testers can push those deployments onto a testnet and interact with the different functions and states, and finally, the team or product manager, can inspect a deploy request, signing off on the deployment once it is deemed safe.

Stay tuned for a video demo to be posted soon.
