# Create a new project

Projects are containers in Loki.code that are linked to your Github repository. They contain your smart contracts, compilations, deploy history, deploy requests, playgrounds and in the case of an organization project, team members.

### Prerequisites

1. [Github linked to Loki.code](link-your-github.md)

### Steps

Start in Loki.code's [Dashboard](https://www.lokicode.app/dashboard/). On the top right of the screen click on New Project.

After that, you will see a list of respositories that you have linked to Loki.code. Go ahead and select the repository that contains the smart contracts you want to work with. Then choose Create Project or Create Organization Project depending on if you plan to work on it alone or with team members, respectively.
