# Create a new project

Projects in Loki.code serve as containers linked to your GitHub repository. They house your smart contracts, compilations, deploy history, deploy requests, playgrounds, and, for Organization Projects, the associated team members.

### Prerequisites

1. [Github linked to Loki.code](link-your-github.md)

### Steps

Begin in Loki.code's Dashboard. At the top right of the screen, click on "New Project."

Following this, you will be presented with a list of repositories that you have linked to Loki.code. Kindly select the repository that contains the smart contracts with which you intend to work. Subsequently, choose "Create Project" if you plan to work independently, or "Create Organization Project" if you envisage collaborating with team members.

Upon selecting one of the two options, you shall be redirected to your project's page. On this page, you will observe a sidebar with three distinguished options:

1. **Files**: Here, you may peruse the files within your GitHub repository. Should you select a Solidity file, you will be afforded the option to compile it.
2. **Deploy**: This section allows you to deploy your compiled contracts, review your deployment history, and approve or reject incoming deploy requests.
3. **API Keys**: In this section, you may generate API keys, which can be provided to your development environment, such as Hardhat or Foundry, to facilitate sending deploy requests to be incorporated into your project.

To view all of your projects, begin at the Dashboard and click on "Projects" in the sidebar. You will be directed to a page where you may access any one of your projects.
